# üèã‚ôÇ Team

_Our team consists of highly qualified individuals who are passionate about what they do. During the recruitment process, our CEO focused on finding not only qualified candidates but also individuals with purpose. As a result, we have a strong, united group with a single goal - to bring Gym-AI to the world, to raise awareness through an AI-integrated platform, and to highlight the importance of good nutrition and a consistent exercise routine. We have two pillars - the Marketing and Development teams - both are exceptional and highly qualified departments. We have parallel action plans, hold daily meetings, and conduct audits throughout the development process to ensure that, above all else, we prioritize safety, efficiency, and ease of use while still being profitable. For more information, please contact our pillars or send us an email._\
