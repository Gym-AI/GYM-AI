# â–ª Rewards app and Gamification implementation

#### Rewards App

_We are developing a section in our app that will encompass reward concepts and aim to maximize our investors' profits through physical activity. As our mission is to promote health and well-being to our investors, we believe the application of the "Move to Earn" concept will be well received, as it combines financial incentives with health. For this, a portion of the portfolio will be reserved for this resource. We are currently testing this section and conducting some experiments with the "Move to Earn" economy, aiming to avoid frauds or sabotages to our app._

#### Gamification implementation

_We developed a rewards program for our investors, in which 15% of our tokenomics will be dedicated to an incentive fund. The program will offer rewards through referral affiliation and later, through intuitive activities and challenges that will be made available on our app. These challenges will be conditioned on the completion of specific tasks and goals set at the beginning of each month. Additionally, we have the "GYM AI," which will consist of a series of questions related to health and well-being, and investors who correctly answer them will receive rewards. This feature will not only help users better understand the operation of a cryptocurrency or platform, but also enhance their knowledge of health and well-being. There will be future developments related to this feature._
