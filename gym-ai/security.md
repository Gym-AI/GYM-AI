#### _KYC & Audit_

_"Know Your Customer" (KYC) and auditing are crucial aspects in ensuring the security and integrity of a cryptocurrency project. KYC is a user identity verification process aimed at preventing fraud and money laundering and ensuring that the project complies with applicable legal regulations. Auditing, on the other hand, is an independent and thorough analysis of the security, integrity, and compliance of the project, including the verification of all technical, financial, and legal aspects. The combination of KYC and auditing provides investors and other stakeholders with confidence and security in the cryptocurrency project, as well as ensuring its legitimacy and long-term viability._

Follow our regulations below.
